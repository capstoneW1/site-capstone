## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

   - We were able to successfully sign in and register a user
   - We were able to successfully set up our postgres schemas and populate our shoes table with content.
   - We were able to successfully set up the routes and models for our backend


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

   - We had some problems with merge conflicts. In the end, we decided to revert back to a branch with bug-free code
   - The user in the auth context is not saved when the user refreshes a page
   - There were some problems with our API giving us back null/ inaccurate data


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

   - We were not able to finish all of the tasks we sought out to finish in Sprint 1, because a merge conflict bug set us back. We are still on track to finish the project by week 9. We plan to prioritize fixing the authentication bug, the remaining Sprint 1 tasks, and then complete next week’s tasks.


* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

   - Git-related resources provided to us by Roy helped us get our site to run again.
    

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

   - The user story “As an everyday consumer, I want to sign up for email updates on sneakers. I will not check back on this site daily, but I do check my email everyday. This email feature will ensure that I am notified as quickly as possible.” is at risk. We plan to make this a stretch feature if this item remains “at-risk.”
