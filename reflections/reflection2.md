## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to produce our MVP 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We struggled with merge conflicts, taking a whole day to resolve it at one point. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were able to finish all of the tasks in our sprint plan for this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes the resources were definitely helpful in executing our sprint this week. One of the main resources that helped out was our past labs which we were able to reference for certain features. Anotoher great resource was the wireframes which helped with website styling. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 We considered the price history feature at risk as we did not have reliable information to implement such a chart. We plan to create a seperate data table in which we populate it with a multiple prices.
