## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

The main purpose of our project is to create a platform for sneaker consumers to view trends and stats regarding their favorite products. This app will also be used to notify consumers regarding sneaker launches. 

Some key features that our site has to offer are the search bar (where users can search for products by name or brand), the product page (where users can view sneaker details, price trends, and the current number of bids and sales of a pair of sneakers), and the wishlist (where users can keep track of their favorite sneakers). 

Our targeted audience will be able to view the current most popular sneakers. Upon logging in, users will be able to view similar sneakers based on their favorited items. Users will have the option to be notified about specific release dates via email. Users will be able to search for specific sneakers and navigate to a page displaying its product details.

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Some websites similar to ours are StockX and Goat. Our project will stand out by delivering hand picked news specific to our users’ favorite brands and notifying them when those specific shoes are being released. 

Currently, StockX has a news section that displays general articles about a wide variety of topics. Our project will be slightly different from this. Users will be able to favorite specific brands and shoes which will tailor the type of news sent to them. 


## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

We still have questions on if our API will be sufficient for our needs for this project. 
- If our API is not sufficient, what is the best alternative to receive our data? 
- Will we be able to get a list of all sneakers and product details?
- Will the response we get from our API be up-to-date?
- Will the API allow us to easily generate a graph regarding price changes over time?

We also have to research how to send our users notifications.
